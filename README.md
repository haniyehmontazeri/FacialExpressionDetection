**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a deep learning architecture for classifying facial 
expressions into 7 categories (angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, surprise). The project will provide hands-on 
experience in designing and applying deep neural network models, with a focus on solving a real-world multi-class 
classification problem. 

**Dataset:** 
The dataset for this project is available online at Kaggle: Facial Expression Dataset. It contains facial expression images 
labelled in 7 categories and is divided into training and testing sets.

**Requirements:**

• You should use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or CNN-based architectures for this classification task. The 
architecture may include techniques like data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization to improve 
model performance. Additionally, you are encouraged to experiment with different architectures, optimizers, 
and learning rates to achieve better results. 

• You may use any programming language or toolbox of your choice, with Python, MATLAB or Octave being 
strongly recommended. You can either write your code from scratch or use publicly available code, as long as 
you properly cite the source and fully understand the implementation.

• Submit the project as a document with the code attached or linked. Ensure that the report includes well
commented code snippets or relevant explanations for the key parts of the implementation.

this project include a structured as follows:

o Introduction: Briefly introduce the facial emotion recognition problem and its significance. Describe the 
dataset used, including a short summary of its structure and the categories of emotions. 

o Model Design: Provide an overview of the neural network architecture you designed. Justify your choice of 
architecture, layers, activation functions, and any other key components. Include a discussion of any pre
processing steps applied to the data, such as normalization or augmentation. 

o Implementation: Explain the programming environment (e.g., language, libraries, and tools) you used for 
implementation. Provide details on how you divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. If 
using any pre-written code, ensure you properly cite its source and explain the algorithm. 

o Training Process: Describe the training process, including the optimizer, learning rate, batch size, and the 
number of epochs. Mention any challenges you faced during training (e.g., overfitting) and how you 
addressed them. 

o Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score. Compare the training and validation performance, discussing potential reasons for any 
differences. Include visualizations of the loss and accuracy over epochs and confusion matrix results. 

o Conclusion: Summarize your findings and the effectiveness of your model. Suggest potential improvements 
or alternative approaches for better performance.
